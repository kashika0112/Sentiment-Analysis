                              Internet targeting people based on sexuality, career, background, etc. These criticisms
                              though baseless have a profound impact on our mental health. Statistics have shown that
                              young users of social media have a substantially high rate of reported depression (13 to
                              66 %). Platforms like Twitter are being maliciously utilized to spread hatred and bigotry.

                         <div class="text">To make ourselves more aware and to tackle depression amongst youngsters, we
                              have come up with the idea of “We Care - Let the worry fly and serenity pave in”, a
                              website aimed at reducing stress levels. It includes a feature of sentiment analysis that
                              allows users to analyze hashtags trending on Twitter. We plan to extract 2500 tweets using
                              the Twitter Developer APIs and train them using the Naive Bayes Algorithm to categorize
                              tweets into positive, negative, and neutral. The modules used would include sklearn,
                              tweepy, numpy, pandas, regex, and matplotlib. We believe that this will ensure that the
                              safety, inclusion, and respect of all communities is not compromised.
